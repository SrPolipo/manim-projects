# Manim Projects

This is a public repository containing a collection of my Manim scripts and animations.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the quality and organization of the code in this repository is not a priority. These scripts are primarily for personal use and experimentation with the Manim animation engine. Use at your own discretion.

## Chaosgame

The chaosgame folder creates a subclass of PMobject for dealing with iterated function systems, which are fractals. The Sierpinski triangle, the Vicsek fractal and a Barnsley fern are already implemented under examples.py.
